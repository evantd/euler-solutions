# programming-challenges
This started as a place to put my solutions to Project Euler problems, but I've started adding interview-question-type programming problems as well. These "challenges" often are not particularly challenging to experienced programmers, but the pressure of an interview can make them feel challenging anyway.

## project-euler
My solutions to Project Euler problems.

## interview
